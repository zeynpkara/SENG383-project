* KidTask – Task & Reward Management System

KidTask is a Java Swing–based desktop application designed to help children develop responsibility through task management and a reward system. Parents and teachers can assign, approve, and evaluate tasks, while children complete tasks, earn points, and track their progress.

 **Project Purpose

The goal of KidTask is to:

Encourage children to complete daily responsibilities

Provide a structured task approval and rating system

Track progress using points, levels, and dashboards

Apply Object-Oriented Programming principles in a real-world project

 ** User Roles & Features
 -Child

View assigned tasks

Filter tasks (today / this week / all)

Mark tasks as completed

View completed tasks and ratings

Earn points and level up

View and manage wishes

 -Parent

Create and assign tasks to children

Approve or reject completed tasks

Rate tasks (1–5)

View child progress and points

Manage wishes

 -Teacher

Approve or reject completed tasks

Rate tasks (1–5)

View dashboard summary

View statistics (approved vs rejected tasks)

Visualize data using charts

 ** Main Functionalities

Task assignment and tracking

Task approval & rating system

Points and level system for children

Role-based dashboards (Child / Parent / Teacher)

Persistent data storage using JSON

Visual dashboard with charts
 ** How to Run the Project

Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA

Make sure Java SDK (Java 17 or compatible) is installed

Run the MainApp.java file

Select a role from the Role Selection screen

 ** Object-Oriented Design

The project follows core OOP principles:

Encapsulation: Private fields with public getters/setters

Inheritance: Child class extends User

Polymorphism: Role-based behavior via User.Role

Separation of Concerns: Model, UI, and Persistence layers

 ** AI Tool Usage

In this project, different AI-powered tools were used at specific stages of the software development lifecycle. Each tool was selected based on its strengths and used as a support mechanism, while the core design decisions and implementations were carried out by the developer.

- DeepSeek

Used mainly during the implementation phase

Assisted in understanding complex logic and refining task workflows

Helped with algorithmic thinking and feature implementation strategies

- Cursor AI

Used during the coding phase

Provided intelligent code completion and refactoring suggestions

Accelerated Java development and improved code readability

Assisted in fixing syntax and logical errors

- Figma & Canva

Used during the design phase

Figma was used to plan UI layouts and dashboard structures

Canva was used to design visual components and layout ideas

Helped visualize role-based dashboards before Swing implementation

- Slidesgo

Used for preparing the final presentation slides

Provided structured and professional slide templates

Improved the visual quality and organization of the project presentation

- Google Gemini

Used during the report writing and presentation preparation

Assisted in improving explanations, wording, and structure

Helped ensure clarity and academic tone in documentation

!! All AI tools were used responsibly and ethically.
The project’s architecture, coding, and final outputs reflect the developer’s own effort and understanding.
